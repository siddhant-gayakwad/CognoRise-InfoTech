5 TASKS :-

TASK 1: NUMBER GUESSING GAME:-

● Generate a random number using the Random class.
● Prompt the user for input using Scanner.
● Compare the user's guess with the generated number.
● Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct using conditional statements (if).
● Use a loop (e.g., while) to allow multiple attempts.
● Track the number of attempts and stop the game after a predefined limit

TASK 2: CALCULATOR APP:-

● Prompt the user for two numbers and an operator using Scanner.
● Perform the corresponding arithmetic operation based on the operator (+, -, \*, /).
● Display the result.
● Use try and catch to handle division by zero or other exceptions.

TASK 3: HANGMAN GAME :-

● Create an array or list of words to choose from.
● Select a random word using the Random class.
● Use a loop to iterate through each turn.
● Prompt the user for a letter using Scanner.
● Check if the letter is in the word and update the display.
● Display the hangman figure based on incorrect guesses.

TASK 4: SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR :-

● Design the calculator's user interface with buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and scientific functions. Include a display area to show the input and results.
● implement event handlers to handle button clicks. Attach action listeners to the buttons to capture user input.
● Implement methods to handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
● For scientific functions, implement methods for functions like square root, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, etc.
● Update the display area with user input and calculation results.
● Implement functionality for the clear button to clear the input and results, and the delete button to delete the last entered digit.
